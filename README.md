# PNControlLibrary

This library demonstrates how to create, load and process remote JSON config files. Look in the Tests how to use the library.

It produces a file like this if you save the data to a file:

[
  {
    "Message" : {
      "expires" : 608824123.41302204,
      "message" : "The data source is behaving oddly, treat with caution!"
    }
  },
  {
    "Url" : {
      "url" : "https:\/\/www.best-byte.co.uk\/inotams.xml"
    }
  }
]
